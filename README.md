Simple Sign-In Form with Validation
This project is a simple sign-in form that validates user input for an email and password using JavaScript onChange functions and event handlers. It provides real-time feedback on the validity of the entered data and confirms a successful sign-up upon submission.

Features
Real-Time Validation:
Email: The email must be longer than 3 characters and contain both "@" and "." symbols.
Password: The password must be at least 8 characters long.
Interactive Feedback:
Displays error messages in red if the input is invalid.
Removes errors and shows a green "All good to go" message when both fields are valid.
